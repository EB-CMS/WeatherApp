## About me

Hello, I'm Cheikhna, a passionate CS student at the Lebanese International University (LIU). Currently, I'm exploring the world of web and mobile development.

I created the WeatherApp as a personal project to solidify my **JavaScript** skills and gain practical experience with the **React Native library**. This is just the beginningâ€”I have exciting plans ahead, including diving into the **MERN Stack** for a series of upcoming **mini-projects**.

I'm enthusiastic about the endless possibilities in the world of coding and look forward to sharing my journey and creations here on GitHub! Connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/EB-CMS) and let's code together!

## Introduction

The **WeatherApp** is a multi page mobile application created with [expo](https://expo.dev/) and designed to show the weather in the current location a user.

## Tech Stack

- [`React-native`](https://reactnative.dev/) :

- Vanilla `JavaScript` :
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

## Libraries

-[React-Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
React Navigation is a popular navigation library for React Native, a framework for building mobile applications using React and JavaScript. React Navigation provides a flexible and customizable way to handle navigation in your React Native applications.

A library that provides access to reading geolocation information, polling current location or subscribing location update events from the device.

- [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)
A performant interface for rendering basic, flat lists, supporting the most handy features.

- [Expo-Icons](https://icons.expo.fyi/Index) :
This library is installed by default on the template project using `npx create-expo-app` and is part of the `expo` package. It is built on top of [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) and uses a similar API. It includes popular icon sets that you can browse at [icons.expo.fyi](https://icons.expo.fyi/Index).

- [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) :
`Moment.js` is a **JavaScript** library designed for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. It provides a simple and consistent **API** for working with dates and times, making it easier to work with date-related operations in **JavaScript**.
